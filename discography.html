			<p>Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became childhood friends and classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent.[5][6] The Jagger family moved to Wilmington, Kent, five miles (8.0 km) away, in 1954.[7] In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley.[7] Jagger met Richards again on 17 October 1961 on platform two of Dartford railway station.[8] The Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records Jagger was carrying revealed a shared interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards.[9][10] Richards and Taylor often met Jagger at his house. The meetings moved to Taylor's house in late 1961 where Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith joined the trio; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.[11] </p>

				<p>In March 1962, the Blues Boys read about the Ealing Jazz Club in Jazz News newspaper, which mentioned Alexis Korner's rhythm and blues band, Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated. The group sent a tape of their best recordings to Korner, who was favourably impressed.[12] On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included slide guitarist Brian Jones, keyboardist Ian Stewart and drummer Charlie Watts.[12] After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.[12]</p>
				
				<p>Jones, no longer in a band, advertised for bandmates in Jazz Weekly, while Stewart found them a practice space;[13] together they decided to form a band playing Chicago blues. Soon after, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart. The first rehearsal included guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band. They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards.[14] In June 1962 the addition of the drummer Tony Chapman completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart and Taylor. According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to Jazz News. When asked by a journalist for the band's name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was "Rollin' Stone".[15][16]</p>

			<p>The group band played their first show billed as "the Rollin' Stones" on 12 July 1962, at the Marquee Club in London.[17][18][19][a] At the time, the band consisted of Jones, Jagger, Richards, Stewart, and Taylor.[22] Shortly afterwards, the band began their first tour of the UK, performing Chicago blues and songs by Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.[23] By 1963 they were finding their musical stride as well as popularity.[24] In 1964 two unscientific opinion polls rated the band as Britain's most popular group, outranking even the Beatles.[25] The band's name was changed shortly after their first gig to "The Rolling Stones".[26][27] The group's then acting manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, secured a Sunday afternoon residency at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, London, in February 1963.[28] He claimed this triggered an "international renaissance for the blues".[29]</p>

				<p>In May 1963, the Rolling Stones signed Andrew Loog Oldham as their manager.[30] His previous clients, the Beatles, directed the former publicist to the band.[31][19] Because Oldham was only nineteen and had not reached the age of majority—he was also younger than anyone in the band—he could not obtain an agent's licence or sign any contracts without his mother co-signing.[31] By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton[32] to secure record financing and assistance booking venues.[30] Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted.[33] Initially, Oldham tried applying the strategy used by Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, and have the band members wear suits. He later changed his mind and imagined a band that contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance. He wanted to make the Stones "a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables" and to "establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic".[34] Stewart left the official line-up, but remained road manager and touring keyboardist. Of Stewart's decision, Oldham later said, "Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for [fans] to remember the faces in the picture."[35] Later, Oldham reduced the band members' ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers.[36]</p>

			The band's second UK LP, The Rolling Stones No. 2, was released in January 1965 and reached No. 1 on the charts. The US version, released in February as The Rolling Stones, Now!, reached No. 5. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles.[78] In January and February that year the band played 34 shows for around 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand.[79] The single "The Last Time", released in February, was the first Jagger/Richards composition to reach No. 1 on the UK charts;[61] it reached No. 9 in the US. It was later identified by Richards as "the bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it."[80]</p>

			<p>Their first international No. 1 hit was "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", recorded in May 1965 during the band's third North American tour. Richards recorded the guitar riff that drives the song with a fuzzbox as a scratch track to guide a horn section. Nevertheless, the final cut was without the planned horn overdubs. Issued in the summer of 1965, it was their fourth UK No. 1 and their first in the US where it spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. It was a worldwide commercial success for the band.[80][81] The US version of the LP Out of Our Heads, released in July 1965, also went to No 1; it included seven original songs, three Jagger/Richards numbers and four credited to Nanker Phelge.[82] Their second international No. 1 single "Get Off of My Cloud" was released in the autumn of 1965,[72] followed by another US-only LP, December's Children.[83]</p>

			The album Aftermath, released in the late spring of 1966, was the first LP to be composed entirely of Jagger/Richards songs;[84] it reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US.[85] On this album Jones' contributions expanded beyond guitar and harmonica. To the Middle Eastern-influenced "Paint It, Black"[c] he added sitar; to the ballad "Lady Jane" he added dulcimer and to "Under My Thumb" he added marimbas. Aftermath also contained "Goin' Home", a nearly 12-minute-long song that included elements of jamming and improvisation.[86]</p>	

			<p>The Stones' success on the British and American singles charts peaked during the 1960s.[87][88] "19th Nervous Breakdown"[89] was released in February 1966, and reached No. 2 in the UK[90] and US charts;[91] "Paint It, Black" reached No. 1 in the UK and US in May 1966.[61][88] "Mother's Little Helper", released in June 1966, reached No. 8 in the US;[91] it was one of the first pop songs to discuss the issue of prescription drug abuse.[92][93] "Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?" was released in September 1966 and reached No. 5 in the UK[94] and No. 9 in the US.[91] It had a number of firsts for the group: it was the first Stones recording to feature brass horns and the back-cover photo on the original US picture sleeve depicted the group satirically dressed in drag. The song was accompanied by one of the first official music videos, directed by Peter Whitehead.[95][96]</p>
